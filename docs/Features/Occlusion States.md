Using the *Render* setting of an outline, it can be configured to render in 3 ways.

1. **Always:** Always render the outline/fill, regardless of its occlusion state in the scene.
2. **When Not Occluded:** Only render the outline/fill when it is not occluded (not hidden behind other geometry).
3. **When Occluded:** Only render the outline/fill when it is occluded (hidden behind other geometry).

The 3 occlusion states are shown below.
