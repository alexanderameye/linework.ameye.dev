The [DOTS Hybrid Renderer](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.rendering.hybrid@0.8/manual/index.html) is used for rendering ECS entities.

Linework should be compatible with the DOTS Hybrid Renderer. However, I don't use ECS personally and don't test it often, so some bugs might still be present. If you encounter any issues with Linework in a project using the DOTS Hybrid Renderer, let me know.
