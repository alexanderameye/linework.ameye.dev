## What's the problem?

The shaders in Linework are not designed to work with virtual reality. This is planned in a future update. 

In the meantime, users have reported getting Linework to work in VR with minimal adjustment to the shaders. These can be found in the Discord community channel.

The roadmap can be found in the [Discord Community](https://discord.com/invite/cFfQGzQdPn) in the *feature-requests* channel.
