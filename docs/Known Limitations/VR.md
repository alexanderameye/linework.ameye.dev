## What's the problem?

I have added VR support in update 1.3.3, and some users have reported that Linework works in VR with these changes. However, I do not own any VR hardware so I am unable to test it personally so I can not guarantee that it works.

However, if you encounter any issues, let me know and I'll see what I can do.
