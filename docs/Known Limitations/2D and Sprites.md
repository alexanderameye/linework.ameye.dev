## What's the problem?

The shaders in Linework are not designed to work with 2D/sprites. This is planned in a future update which could come in the form of a paid upgrade, depending on how much work is involved.

The roadmap can be found in the [Discord Community](https://discord.com/invite/cFfQGzQdPn) in the *feature-requests* channel.
