## What's the problem?

The currently are some rendering issues between [[wide outline]] and MSAA. This will be fixed in a future update. You can disable MSAA on your render pipeline asset to get rid of these issues.

The roadmap can be found in the [Discord Community](https://discord.com/invite/cFfQGzQdPn) in the *feature-requests* channel.
