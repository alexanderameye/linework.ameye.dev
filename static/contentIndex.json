There is no one-size-fits-all solution for outlines. Linework includes multiple techniques, balancing visual fidelity and performance.\nPerformant. Leveraging the power of the SRP batcher, Linework is able to render multiple outlines within a single batch.\nEasy to use. A considerable amount of development time has gone into finetuning the user experience for Linework so that is is user-friendly while still being flexible.\n\nBy combining these 3 core focus points, Linework thrives to be the one-stop solution for rendering outlines in Unity.\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Does Linework support X/Y/X? Why is only Unity 6 supported? \n                  \n                \n\nLinework is only compatible with Unity 6 and the Universal Render Pipeline. Other combinations are not supported. See Compatibility for more detailed information.\nThe reason that only Unity 6 is supported is because of the introduction of the Render Graph API. This is a breaking change that drastically changes how custom render effects in the Universal Render Pipeline are written. I do not want to spend the bulk of my time supporting and maintaining what is essentially the same render effect, implemented using multiple APIs. That’s why I focus on a single version and the introduction of the Render Graph API is the ideal cut-off point for this.\nThe reason that only the Universal Render Pipeline is supported is because URP will be the future default renderer in Unity.\n\n"},"concepts/occlusion-states":{"title":"Occlusion States","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The Render setting for outlines and fills usually has 3 options.\nRender Always\nAlways render the outline/fill, regardless of its occlusion state in the scene.\n\nRender When Not Occluded\nOnly render the outline/fill when it is not occluded (not hidden behind other geometry).\n\nRender When Occluded\nOnly render the outline/fill when it is occluded (hidden behind other geometry).\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Occlusion State Options + Bleeding \n                  \n                \n\nDue to technical limitations, not all outline types support all 3 Occlusion State options.\n\n\nThe Fast Outline and Surface Fill effects support the different occlusion states the best.\n\n\nThe Soft Outline and Wide Outline effects may display bleeding due to these effects rendering in screen-space.\n\n\n\nThe Edge Detection effect does not support occlusion states.\n\n\n\n"},"concepts/outline-bleeding":{"title":"Outline Bleeding","links":["1-projects/linework/docs/outlines/soft-outline","1-projects/linework/docs/outlines/wide-outline"],"tags":[],"content":"Issue\nFor the Soft Outline and Wide Outline outline effects, the outlines are rendered by having a silhouette that is dilated in screen-space. Because of the screen-space nature of this effect, the outline will not always completely respect the configured Occlusion State. This is especially apparent for wide outlines.\nIn the example below, the outline is set to render When Not Occluded however the outline bleeds slightly over the other object in the scene.\n\nSolutions\nThere are 2 solutions that may help with the bleeding effect.\nTransparent Outline\nYou can add an additional outline that is set to render When Occluded and set the transparency of the color to 0%.\n\nThis will make it so the outline is hidden where it needs to be. The downside of this method is that for the Wide Outline, it might over-correct and a little part of the outline is occluded where it shouldn’t be.\n\nDue to the dilation step, this solution does not work for the Soft Outline.\nRender As Mask\nA second method is to mask out parts of the outline by assigning objects to render As Mask which will effectively mask out the outline. In the example below, the box is set to render As Mask and the outline is then occluded.\n\nThis method works well for both the Soft Outline and the Wide Outline.\n"},"concepts/rendering-layer-masks":{"title":"Rendering Layer Masks","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"All outline and fill effects make use of the Rendering Layer Mask system in Unity to control which objects should receive an outline. Using this system you gain a lot of flexibility to define which objects receive which outlines.\nAs an example, you could have a Default Rendering Layer and an Enemy Rendering Layer. All objects that should have an outline can then get added to the Default Rendering Layer and a yellow outline could be assigned to that rendering layer. Objects that are in a temporary Enemy State could then be temporarily added (by script) to the Enemy Rendering Layer and a red, striped fill effect could be assigned to that rendering layer.\n\nTo get started with setting up a rendering layer, you can follow these steps.\n1. Create a Rendering Layer\nGo to Project Settings &gt; Tags and Layers. In here, add a layer (or replace one of the Light Layers if you are not making use of them).\n\n2.

However, be sure that you read the documentation carefully. If things do not work out of the box or you have questions, Contact me. Thanks!\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Section Map \n                  \n                \n\nThe Section Map is a special texture that is generated during the rendering process and used by the edge detection shader to determine where to draw edges. The section map uses only the R channel. Additionaly, there are 2 special values that the section map may have.\n0.0 = mask → no lines will be drawn\n1.0 = fill → a special Fill Color will be drawn\nWhen using Vertex Colors or a Section Texture as explained below, be sure to note that values of 0 will be used as a mask, and values of 1 will be used as a fill.\n\n\nThe Section Map allows us to introduce additional information for the edge detection shader to use, without adding additional geometry. Some examples:\nObject ID\nEach object is rendered to the Section Map using an unique ID. Works well to render outlines between objects. No manual control is possible, everything is generated based on world position.\n  \nVertex Colors\nThe vertex colors of an object may be rendered to the section map. This gives nearly complete control over outlines. The only limitation is that the necessary geometry needs to be present in order to paint it. This method is able to generate very clean outlines. As explained above, be sure to note that values of 0 will be used as a mask, and values of 1 will be used as a fill.\n \nSection Texture\nIn this mode, a dedicated Section Texture is sampled and used to render to the section map. This gives very fine control over outlines. Again, keep in mind that a value of 0.0 = mask and 1.0 = fill.\nIn the settings of the Section Map you can choose\n\nThe Section Texture that will be sampled.\nThe UV Set that will be used to sample the texture. This allows you to have a different UV set specifically for your section texture.\nThe Channel that will be sampled.\n\n\nWithin the package, there is a section_texture.png which is recommended for you to use. It contains a 4x4 palette in tints of red. The bottom left value is 0.0 = mask and the top left is 1.0 = fill.\n\nIn your 3D modelling program, you can set up a secondary UV map.\n\nYou can then UV map your mesh so that surfaces that should have an edge between, have a different color in the palette.\n\nThen in Unity you can choose which UV set to use.\nAs explained above, be sure to note that values of 0 will be used as a mask, and values of 1 will be used as a fill.\n \nThe Section Texture method involves a bit more work than the Vertex Colors method.\nKeyword\nThe Keyword method is yet another technique to render to the section map. Before rendering to the section map, the _SECTION_PASS keyword is enabled. After, the keyword is disabled again. This makes it possible to add a _SECTION_PASS switch at the end of your shaders so you can output whatever you want to the section map.\nIn the example below I output a pattern of stripes.\n\nThis gives us the following section map and result.\n \nAs explained above, be sure to note that values of 0 will be used as a mask, and values of 1 will be used as a fill.\nThe Keyword method leaves everything to you. You can output anything you want, irregardless of the geometry of your mesh.\nWhat option to choose?\nLet’s summarize all the options of outputting to the section map.\nVertex Color: Easiest to use. You could make/use tools that randomly assign a color to a face.\n\n\n                  \n                  Vertex Color Tooling \n                  \n                \n\nYou could use something like IDMapper (I have not tested this personally!) to make it easier to assign vertex colors quickly\nIDMapper - Blender Market\n\n\nSection Texture: More setup involved since you need to make a secondary UV map. This also requires you to come up without some kind of method/system so that faces next to each other, don’t use the same color.\nKeyword: Use this if you have very specific needs of certain patterns that should be shown, independent of the geometry of your mesh.\nAnti-aliasing\nTODO:  check “MSAA will not apply to the edges, since the depth texture is remains aliased. Post processing AA methods do have an effect.”\nTODO: check “An edge has a minimum thickness of 1 pixel. This means at lower resolutions, edges will appear thicker.

There are 8 different options available that control how the mesh is extruded.\nEach option below is shown in an extreme way with an big outline width. For a lot of methods, bigger widths will result in an outline with gaps.\nVertex Position (OS)\nMove each vertex along the vertex position in object space.\n\nNormalized Vertex Position (OS)\nMove each vertex along the normalized vertex position in object space.\n\nNormal Vector (OS)\nMove each vertex along the normal vector in object space.\n\nVertex Color (OS)\nMove each vertex along the vertex color in object space.\nNormal Vector (CS)\nMove each vertex along the normal vector in clip space.\n\nNormal Vector (SS)\nMove each vertex along the normal in screen space.\n\nNormal Vector (WS)\nMove each vertex along the normal in world space.\n\nBaked Direction UV8 (OS)\nMove each vertex along the direction extracted from the UV8 channel in object space.\nScaling\nThe Fast Outline supports 2 methods of scaling the outline. Either the outline has a consistent screen-space width, or it is scaled by distance. The main difference will be when zooming out, when the object that is outline takes up a small space of the scene.\nConstant\nThe outlines will always take up the same width in terms of screen-space pixels. When zooming out, this may become disproportionally large compared to the smaller object it is outlining.\nScale With Distance\nThe outlines will be reduced in size while zooming out. This will keep the outline the same size relative to the object it is outlining. You can also set a Minimum Width to keep the outlines from becoming so small that you can no longer see them.\nArtifacts\nThe Fast Outline effect renders outlines by rendering an extruded version of a mesh. This extrusion step may show some artifacts. The reason is that each vertex of the mesh is moved in a certain direction in 3D space, but with different vertices moving in different directions, this may introduce gaps or sharp edges in the extruded mesh. The artifacts may be especially noticeable on meshes with sharp edges. There are several ways to mitigate these issues.\n\nExtrusion method: Try using a different extrusion method in the outline settings. Some extrusion methods may produce better results in your case.\nNormal vector smoothing: In your 3D modelling software you could smooth the normal vectors of your mesh. This should produce a smoother outline as well. If you don’t want to directly smooth the normal vectors of your mesh, you could store a smoothed version of the normal vectors in the vertex colours and use the Vertex Color Extrusion method in the outline settings.\n\nLimitations\nThere are some known limitations that come with the implementation of the Fast Outline effect."},"outlines/soft-outline":{"title":"Soft Outline","links":["support/performance","concepts/rendering-layer-masks","concepts/occlusion-states","concepts/outline-bleeding"],"tags":[],"content":"Soft Outline renders outlines by generating a silhouette of an object and applying a dilation/blur effect, resulting in smooth, soft-edged contours around objects.\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Advantages \n                  \n                \n\n\nSoft Edges: Good for rendering soft/glowy outlines, but also supports solid outlines.\nObject Exclusion: Easily select which specific objects should receive an outline.\n\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Disadvantages \n                  \n                \n\n\nInner Lines: No inner lines are rendered.

There are several options available to control how the silhouette is dilated.\nBox\nA box blur is applied. Controlled through a Width parameter.\n\nGaussian\nA Gaussian blur is applied. Has an additional Spread parameter. Results in smoother outlines at a slight performance cost.\n\nKawase\nA Kawase blur is applied.\n\nDilate\nA dilation effect is applied.\n\nClosed Loop\nThe Soft Outline effect has a Closed Loop option. This option is only available when the When Not Occluded render option is selected.\nIt results in the outline being a single closed loop.\n\nLimitations\nThere are some known limitations that come with the implementation of the Soft Outline effect.\n\n\n                  \n                  Hard Outline Color \n                  \n                \n\nWhen using the Hard outline type, the color of the outline is shared between all outlines.\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Outline Bleeding \n                  \n                \n\nBecause the silhouette is dilated in screen-space, the outline will not always completely respect the configured Occlusion State. This is especially apparent for wide outlines.\nIn the example below, the outline is set to render When Not Occluded however the outline bleeds slightly over the other object in the scene.\n\nSee Outline Bleeding for ways to resolve this.\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Overlapping Effects \n                  \n                \n\nIf 2 outlined objects overlap in the scene, the interaction of the outlines might not always be what you expected. The reason is that all objects render to the same silhouette buffer, which is then blurred a single time (for performance reasons) and also sampled a single time.\nFor example, the following 2 outlines are set to render Always, yet they are broken up at the intersection and so not in fact rendering always.\n\nAnother example is these 2 outlines that are set to render When Occluded. However, the outlines never rendered.\n\nThis limitation is present because the objects share the same silhouette that is then blurred. To get around these issues, each outline should have its own silhouette that is then blurred separately, which is prohibitively expensive.\n\n"},"outlines/surface-fill":{"title":"Surface Fill","links":["support/performance","concepts/rendering-layer-masks","concepts/occlusion-states"],"tags":[],"content":"Surface Fill renders fills by rendering an object with a fill material.\n\nConfiguration\nThe Surface Fill Settings object contains the settings related to this fill effect.

The advantage is explained below.\nIn the default mode, you can set a different outline color to be used when the outline is occluded by having 1 outline render When Not Occluded and have another outline render When Occluded.\n\nThis results in the following effect where you see that some parts of the outline are occluded. One issue with this effect is that each pixel of the outline calculates it’s occlusion state based on whether the pixel closest to it that is part of the cone, is occluded or not. So not the actual occlusion of the outline pixel is taken into account.\n\nWhen enabling the Custom Depth option, you can set an Occluded Color property that decides the color of the outline when occluded. The Render options for each outline also disappear.\n\nWhen using the Custom Depth mode, you will see that the outline occlusion is more accurate.\n\nThe downside of this method is that you lose some control and also there might be some depth buffer related artifacts.\n\nLimitations\nThere are some known limitations that come with the implementation of the Wide Outline effect.\n\n\n                  \n                  Outline Bleeding \n                  \n                \n\nBecause the silhouette is dilated in screen-space, the outline will not always completely respect the configured Occlusion State.

Multiple techniques can be used, balancing visual quality and performance. Both full-screen outlines (for outlined art-styles) as per-object outlines are supported. You can also combine outlines with fill effects such as patterns and overlays. The toolkit is designed to be feature-rich and straightforward to use.\n\n\nYou can get Linework from the asset store here\nassetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/294140.\n\nUseful Links\nAsset Store: assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/294140\nDiscord: discord.gg/cFfQGzQdPn\nGetting Started Common Questions Roadmap Troubleshooting and Known Limitations"}}
